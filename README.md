# Single Person 2d Joint Position Estimation Project: 

Human pose estimation is the task of localizing key joint locations given a picture containing a person. This pose estimation model utilizes a basic Visual Transformer backbone and decoder for single person human pose estimation tasks implemented in PyTorch.  The model was trained on the LSP, LSP extended and MPII human pose datasets. This model is not pretrained on any masking tasks as we were trying to test the feasability of performing this task without a pre-trained backbone.  



We have returned to this project in the summer of 2024 after completing our undergraduate degrees and are working to finalize model training and to create a user interface for the model.
